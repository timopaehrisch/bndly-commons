# Bndly.org

**bndly.org** is a HATEOAS framework written in Java. It facilitates the implementation of hypermedia-driven REST APIs that adhere to HATEOAS principles. HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a key aspect of the REST architectural style, allowing clients to navigate and control the application dynamically without prior explicit knowledge of available interactions.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Bndly.org provides an intuitive API for creating HATEOAS-compliant REST services.
- **Flexible**: Supports various data formats and can be easily integrated into existing applications.
- **Extensible**: Bndly.org is modular and can be customized to meet specific needs through plugins and extensions.

## Installation

To use Bndly.org in your project, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bndly</groupId>
    <artifactId>bndly</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Ensure that you specify the correct version compatible with your project.

## Getting Started

Here is a simple example of how to create a HATEOAS-compliant endpoint with Bndly.org:

```java
import org.bndly.rest.api.Context;
import org.bndly.rest.controller.api.ControllerResource;
import org.bndly.rest.controller.api.GET;
import org.bndly.rest.controller.api.Path;

@Path("/example")
public class ExampleResource implements ControllerResource {

    @GET
    public Context getExample() {
        Context context = new Context();
        context.addLink("self", "/example");
        context.setData("message", "Welcome to Bndly.org!");
        return context;
    }
}
```

In this example, a simple REST endpoint is created that returns a message and adds a `self` link.
